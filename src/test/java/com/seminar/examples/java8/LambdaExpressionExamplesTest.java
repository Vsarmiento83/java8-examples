/**
 * Examples of lambda expressions, implemented as a JUnit test case.
 * <p>
 * A lambda expression is an anonymous function - unlike a method it has no name, and isn't associated with (declared as
 * part of) a class. They can be passed as an argument to a method (a means of passing behaviour), stored in a variable,
 * or returned as a result.
 * <p>
 * A lambda expression has a type of {@link java.lang.FunctionalInterface} when used in assignment statements or passed
 * as a method parameter.
 * <p>
 * The syntax of a lambda expression is like that of a method, comprising: <br>
 * - Typed parameters (the left hand side of the {@code ->}). If the function takes no parameters then you use an empty
 * set of brackets: ().<br>
 * - A body (the right hand side of the {@code ->}) <br>
 * - A return type. For simple cases you can skip the return statement and the compiler will infer the return type.<br>
 * - Declaration of thrown exceptions. <br>
 * For example <br>
 * {@code FileFilter filter = (File f) -> f.getName().endsWith("*.html")}

   * Java 8 provides a new syntax known as a method reference that allows you to use existing methods to pass around
   * behaviour in the same way as a lambda expression, but with a different syntax.
   * <p>
   * Method references can be used when you already have an existing class and method that implements a functional
   * interface, e.g. {@link java.util.function.Predicate}). As well as offering a terser, more readable syntax, a method
   * reference provides better code reuse, and avoids code duplication, when compared to a repeatedly used lambda
   * expression.
   * <p>
   * There are 4 main types of method references: <br>
   * 1) A reference to a static (class-level) method <br>
   * 2) A reference to a method on the object supplied as the first param of the lambda<br>
   * 3) A reference to a method on any other object.<br>
   * 4) A reference to a constructor.
   * <p>
   * This test shows an example of the 2nd type - a reference to a method on the object supplied as the first param of a
   * lambda expression.
   * 
   * @see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html">Oracle Tutorial - Method
   * References</a>
